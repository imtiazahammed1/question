                        JavaScript is called a Client-side Scripting Language and one of the most commonly
                        used scripting languages (1).That means it is a computer programming language that runs inside
                        the web-browsers but one important thing to remember is that client's web-browser also needs to
                        support the JavaScript Code (2). That's why now-a-days most of the modern web browsers have
                        their JavaScript engines (3). For example, Google Chrome has its own JavaScript engine called V8
                        and Mozilla Firefox has its own JavaScript engine called SpiderMonkey (4).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        So, whenever we run a JavaScript program inside a web browser, JavaScript code is received by
                        the browser's engine and the engine will execute each line of the file from top to bottom (5).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        First of all, JavaScript engine will parse the code line by line and and if an error is detected
                        by the parser, it throws a kind of error and stops execution of the code and if there are no
                        mistakes/errors in the code, it creates the data structure called AST (it stands for Abstract
                        Syntax Tree) (6).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Once the Abstract Syntax Tree is created by the parser, the JavaScript engine converts the
                        JavaScript code into the machine code and then execute it (7).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And this is why JavaScript actually works (8).

                        <strong>Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?</strong>

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        The difference between local storage and session storage is given below:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        i) <strong>How to store:</strong> LocalStorage stores data with no expiration date whereas
                        SessionStorage stores data for one session that means data is lost when the browser tab is
                        closed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        ii) <strong>Better Choice:</strong> SessionStorage is a better choice over LocalStorage because
                        session data is cleared when the browser tab is closed.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        iii) <strong>How to delete:</strong> LocalStorage data need to be deleted via JavaScript by
                        using clear method of local storage [For ex: localStorage.clear()] whereas SessionStorage data
                        is deleted when the browser tab or page session ends.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        iv) <strong>Accessible from:</strong> We can access the LocalStorage from any window whereas
                        SessionStorage needs the same tab for access.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        v) <strong>Capacity:</strong> LocalStorage capacity is 5-10 Mbs(Browser Dependent) whereas
                        SessionStorage capacity is always about 5 Mb.
